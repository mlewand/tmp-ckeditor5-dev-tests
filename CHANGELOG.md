=========

## [19.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/compare/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests@18.2.1...@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-tests@19.0.0) (2020-04-23)

### BREAKING CHANGES

* Omitting the language property in the `CKEditorWebpackPlugin` will not have any effect from now. This means that in both cases only the main `language` will be added to the main bundle and translations for other languages will be saved in separate files.

From now, the source code will not be changed by the translation process, translations for the main language will be added to the bundle(s) and translations for other languages will be outputted to separate executable Javascript files.

* Introduced support for plural translation forms. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#6526](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6526). Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#988](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/988). ([305590e](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev/commit/305590e))
